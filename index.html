            This react native was made by facebook developers. In the code, render means function draw. On viewing the site, line 2 represents that we take button, view and text from react native. Now we mostly create something in view tab. Remember in this platform the first word is capital. We use text style={{marginTop:220}} in angular bracket then closed it. A little before we used two curly brackets to represent that first curly bracket means we are taking information from javascript and second means that we are using to represent that we are putting information. Then we also created a function called RedButton. We used a button extend and through that line we can understand that RedButton is a child and it is inheriting characteristics from Component. We created a RedButton and then called it.
